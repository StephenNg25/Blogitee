For database 'posts' table:

1./ ALTER TABLE posts ADD CONSTRAINT FK_blog_category FOREIGN KEY (category_id) REFERENCES categories (id) ON DELETE SET NULL;

Explanation:
ALTER TABLE posts:

Modifies the posts table to add a new constraint.
ADD CONSTRAINT FK_blog_category:

Adds a foreign key constraint named FK_blog_category (a custom name for the constraint).
FOREIGN KEY (category_id):

Specifies that the category_id column in the posts table is a foreign key.
REFERENCES categories (id):

Specifies that category_id in the posts table references the id column in the categories table. This means every category_id in the posts table must match an id in the categories table (or be NULL).
ON DELETE SET NULL:

Defines the behavior when a referenced record in the categories table is deleted. If a category is deleted, all category_id values in the posts table that reference this category are set to NULL instead of being removed.

2./ ALTER TABLE posts ADD CONSTRAINT FK_blog_author FOREIGN KEY (author_id) REFERENCES users (id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

Explanation:
ALTER TABLE posts:

Modifies the posts table to add a new constraint.
ADD CONSTRAINT FK_blog_author:

Adds a foreign key constraint named FK_blog_author (another custom name for the constraint).
FOREIGN KEY (author_id):

Specifies that the author_id column in the posts table is a foreign key.
REFERENCES users (id):

Specifies that author_id in the posts table references the id column in the users table. This means every author_id in the posts table must match an id in the users table (or be NULL).
ON DELETE CASCADE:

Defines the behavior when a referenced record in the users table is deleted. If an author (a user) is deleted, all posts by this author in the posts table are also deleted automatically.


3./ Purpose of This Code:
+) Enforces Referential Integrity:

--> Ensures category_id in posts always points to a valid id in categories.
--> Ensures author_id in posts always points to a valid id in users.

+) Handles Deletion Rules:

--> If a category is deleted, the associated posts' category_id becomes NULL (but the posts remain in the table).
--> If an author (user) is deleted, all their associated posts are deleted from the posts table (cascade deletion).

Conclusion: This setup is useful for ensuring a robust relational database design and avoiding orphaned records.
